READ ME!

Or don't.  It doesn't really matter to me.

How could it?  I am no dictator of the future.  What happens beyond the here and now, beyond my realm of influence, how could I ever let such things trouble me?  

So read, or don't read, or read some and not others.  Who am I to say?

But then again, who are you?
